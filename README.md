# Content management system, modeled for Prime Academy
Students and Instructors are navigating several websites and content servers, including Github and Gmail, all for the purpose of tracking assignments. This creates unnecessary confusion for both students and instructors. Prime Instructor email is overloaded, and keeping track of student work is convoluted. It is difficult for instructors to give feedback on student projects. Additionally, students submit assignments via email and do not know if their work was received, how well they did, or what they can improve.
	This app aims to solve student worry and lack of individual, specific feedback on their work, while also solving instructor need for content management and assessment. The app will allow students a consistent route to submit assignments, receive feedback, and review their previous work. The app will also allow instructors to create assignments, receive and review their cohortâ€™s work, and give feedback. This app will be able to serve a cohort in prestudy through graduation.
This app is not a replacement for Github nor email. It is meant as a way to manage student projects throughout their lifecycle.
